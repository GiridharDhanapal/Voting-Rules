# Voting-Rules
This project implements various voting systems in Python to analyze election outcomes based on different rules. It allows us explore how rankings and scoring methods influence the winner selection. Also, this project demonstrates the ability to work with functions and advanced Python operations, file handling, and error handling.

## Project Features

**Multiple Voting Rules:** The project implements several voting rules as functions as you can see in the code.

**Tie Breaking Mechanisms:** It handles ties in voting results using various tie-breaking methods like max - highest value wins, min - lowest value wins, or selecting the alternative preferred by a specific agent.

**Data Handling from Excel:** The project can process agent valuation data from Excel files using the openpyxl library.

## How to use

To use this code, you need Python installed on your system along with the openpyxl library for handling .xlsx files. The code processes data from an Excel worksheet where rows represent agents and columns represent alternatives. Each cell contains a numerical value representing how much an agent values an alternative. 

## Further Exploration

Can Implement additional voting rules.

Visualize the results using libraries like Matplotlib.

## Learning Outcomes

Demonstrate knowledge of imperative programming concepts like variables, assignments, conditional statements, loops, and methods.
Design and code applications in Python.
Work with data from Excel files openpyxl library.
